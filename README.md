In this project, I was tasked with designing an SPI slave connected to RAM. I created an SPI slave with identical specifications to serve as a reference model for checking the design. The RAM specifications are as follows:

The SPI slave design was based on the Finite State Machine (FSM) provided here:

Subsequently, I developed a verification plan encompassing constraints, functional coverage, and assertions. The verification plan for the SPI slave can be found here:

Similarly, the verification plan for the RAM is available here:

Throughout the process, I identified and rectified all detected bugs until achieving satisfactory coverage sign-off.
